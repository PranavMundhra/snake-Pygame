Snake Game 
This Python code uses Pygame to create a classic Snake game:

Setup: Initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, and defines initial positions for the snake and food.
Functions: Generates food coordinates and handles reading/writing the high score from/to a CSV file.
Game Loop: Continuously updates the game state and renders game elements.
Handles user input for controlling the snake's movement.
Manages snake movement, growth, and collision detection with boundaries and itself.
Renders the game screen with the snake, food, current score, and high score.
Game Termination: Ends the game if the snake collides with itself or if the player closes the window.
Features: Offers smooth controls, boundary teleportation, collision detection, score tracking, and a persistent high score system using CSV files.
This Snake game provides players with the classic experience of controlling a growing snake, aiming to maximize their score while avoiding collisions. It's a compact implementation with essential features for an engaging gaming session.
